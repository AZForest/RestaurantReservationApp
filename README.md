# RestaurantReservationApp

 A monorepo that serves as a resturant reservation service, utilized by a resturant employee to create, update, and delete guest reservations and tables. That app also allows an user to 'seat' guest reservations at tables, display reservations by date, and search for guest reservations via phone number.
